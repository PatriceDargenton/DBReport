# DBReport
DataBase Reporting tool for DataBase Administrator

Database Administrators needs to compare database structures. Using WinMerge on sql database structure files, it is difficult to compare because a lot of differences appear, whereas only a few of them are meaningful. DBReport shows only (and all) significant information that makes sense for daily administrator work.
See the documentation : DBReport.html
